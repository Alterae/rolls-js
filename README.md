# rolls

A typescript/javascript thing for rolling dice.

## Usage

I honestly don't know. I guess you could import it into your own project? But it isn't a node module so good luck with that.

Read the documentation comments to find out how things work.

To run the code:

```console
node ./out/rolls.js
```

To compile the typescript:

```console
tsc

```

## Dependencies

-   `node`.
-   `typescript`.
-   Preferably a shell that supports shebangs.
