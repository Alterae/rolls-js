# rolls

A typescript/javascript thing for rolling dice.

> **⚠️ NOTE:**
> Please do not actually use this code. It is terrible and I need to rewrite it to not be terrible. The purpose of this project was to learn and it served that purpose, but it is not actually very useful.

## Usage

I honestly don't know. I guess you could import it into your own project? But it isn't a node module so good luck with that.

Read the documentation comments to find out how things work.

To run the code:

```console
node ./out/rolls.js
```

To compile the typescript:

```console
tsc
```

## Dependencies

-   `node`.
-   `typescript`.

## To Do

-   [ ] Turn this into a usable command-line tool.
-   [ ] Clean up the API (and make it an actual API).
-   [ ] Clean up the internal structure.
-   [ ] Maybe make it a node module.
-   [ ] _Big_ maybe put it on npm or something.
