# rolls

A typescript/javascript thing for rolling dice.

## Usage

I honestly don't know. I guess you could import it into your own project? But it isn't a node module so good luck with that.

Read the documentation comments to find out how things work.

You can run the code by running [`run.sh`](./run.sh) or by running [`out/rolls.js`](./out/rolls.js) either via `node` or (in shells that support shebangs) directly.

To build the code, run [`build.sh`](./build.sh). You can also call `tsc` manually, but then the output script won't be directly runnable.

## Dependencies

-   `node`.
-   `typescript`.
-   Preferably a shell that supports shebangs.

## To Do

- [ ] Turn this into a usable command-line tool.
- [ ] (Maybe) make it a node module.
- [ ] (*Big* maybe) put it on npm or something.
